                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>Since moving to the United States, I have found deep connection with teaching as it was a great medium to stay connected with the fundamentals and enrich my own knowledge about the art form. Starting off teaching in apartment patios, students' homes by traveling distances, I quickly settled to teaching out of my own garage just a handful of students. This continued until 2010 when eventually, NLD was founded in October that year. Throughout my journey, Guru has played a pivotal role especially my beloved Guruji under whom I was able to accomplish my dream of performing Arangetram and who also took me to perform at many more stages post so it was but natural for me to establish this school of learning, sharing and growing on his birth anniversary - 19th October 2010. In the years to come, I also have had the privilege, fortune and honor to learn and train under Guru Smt. Gayatri Subramaniam and more recently Guru Smt. Vidhya Subramanian. With the blessings and guidance of my beloved Guruji and the love I receive from all of my other Gurus &amp; Mentors, I have held on to the core principles and values that sets NLD apart. The school follows the Thanjavur &amp; Vazhuvoor style of Bharatanatyam. At NLD, we take pride in preserving the traditional roots of this divine art. We are strong believers of the Guru-Shishya Parampara and strive to preserve the authenticity of our art and culture. The core techniques and values of this art are imparted to eager learners (young and adult alike) in a focused setting. Every student and parent makes NLD what it is today and I am ever grateful to the Lord, my Gurus and my well-wishers for this blessing.The journey has been very enriching and one that has been worth reflecting upon. In 2018, with blessings of my Gurus and sheer courage, I staged my very first student for an arangetram. Ever since, NLD has presented 10 in all and looks forward to presenting the 11th student to present an Arangetram on the 3rd August, 2025. To see these students take on the baton of the art form further through performing at various platforms and teaching the next generation, feels extremely gratifying to witness. Read more about two of my dedicated teachers who are young yet very mature dancers who hold on to the same values &amp; principles. There are also other teaching assistants who spend their time in working with young learners alongside of the main teachers and I can't wait to see them blossom into mature artists and teachers at our school in the times to come.&nbsp;</p>
