                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">With the blessings of Lord Almighty, I humbly offer my salutations at the feet of all my gurus and share with you all a glimpse into my relationship with my passion for over 3 decades now, making “My journey” thus far nothing short of a blessing and hoping for the journey to continue beyond. I am also very grateful for the continuous support of my family and my very near and dear friends throughout this time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">In 1983, as a 5 year old I set out learning this beautiful art form of Bharatanatyam and a decade later, I completed my Arangetram under the able guidance and tutelage of my beloved Guru Shri. K.J.Govindarajan Pillai of Bharata Natya Niketan, New Delhi. In the decade following that, I performed extensively under various banners in and around the capital city of India as well as in Chennai and Chidambaram.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">After moving to the USA, in 2000, I started teaching young children, all the while envisioning spreading this art form to larger recipients. The vision became a reality in 2010 and Nritya Laya Darpan ~ Reflecting the Art of Dance and Rhythm, my vision, started to take form. It has been a very gratifying and enriching journey with learnings along the way. Having started from less than a handful to a good number of students today, from an apartment patio to a garage to rented spaces and now to a studio of our own, this decade + ride has been eventful and for that I am extremely humbled and indebted to Him for having bestowed His grace upon me.

In 2018, I was fortunate to showcase my very first student’s maiden performance in what is called an “Arangetram”, a milestone in every teacher's journey while in the presence of my Guru Smt. Vidhya Subramaniam and esteemed guests of honor. With 8 more Arangetrams that have followed ever since, not only have I gained more experience but also a strong support in the form of the families that backs this growth.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">Nritya Laya Darpan continues to cater to the students of today bringing along several accomplishments through dedicated learning of the art form. 13 years since the school's inception, it stays true to its core principles and values, offering plenty of opportunities and platforms for our students to shine and showcase their passion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span style="background-color: transparent;">On 21st October 2023, our school showcased our annual recital at the Lakireddy Auditorium of Livermore Temple as a “Guru Samarpanam” which was the pleasant result of the years of hard work. Continuing to keep up with the tradition of performing, teaching and learning, the three integral aspects for keeping up with this rich traditional art form, it fills my heart with pride to see that the torch is passed on to the next generation of aspiring students who are taking on various stages to showcase their passion. With student solo performances coming up, our school is also geared up for a great year ahead.&nbsp;</span><br><br><br></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">My first dance teacher came from southern India and was living in government allotted quarters. She has been a true inspiration for me to know how dedication, passion and commitment can turn to accomplishments which is not bound by age. She taught tirelessly for several years and gave me a lot of opportunities to rid myself of the fears of being on stage with several pairs watching over. She now resides in Tanjore District of Tamil Nadu, where she continues to teach young girls. She was recently awarded with Dr.APJAbdul Kalam Award in recognition to her efforts in Bharatanatyam.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><br><strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">Under whom my Arangetram happened ~ Guru Sri. K.J.Govindarajan Pillai</span></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Guruji as I fondly called him, adopted me as his disciple after my first guru moved back south and my yearning for the art form kept brewing. Under his able tutelage and guidance, the love for the art form started growing. Following strict routines, he&nbsp;encouraged me to complete my arangetram. Upon the completion of which, I realized that I could not let go of the aesthetic dance from my life. Just about a year later, Guruji left me and many others only to leave us yearning to be satisfied which in my case was fulfilled by his daughter/disciple Smt. Kalaivani&nbsp;Rajmohan. I trained under her guidance until 2000 after which I moved to Bay Area, CA, USA.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Akka as I fondly address, received her initial training from her foster parents&nbsp;Guru Shri G.V. Ramani&nbsp;andSmt. Ranganayaki,&nbsp;Periappa and Periamma as she called them, who were both pioneers in the field of dance. At a stage where I was deprived from regular learning under a Guru, Akka&nbsp;generously accepted me under her tutelage.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"><br><strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">Under whom I transformed ~ Nritya Choodamani Guru Smt. Vidhya Subramaniam</span></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">After much longing and yearning, I sought to continue and pursue my passion to learn from Vidhya Akka and she graciously agreed to spare time from her busy schedule to train me with nuances of the art form as perceived from an artist's point of view. Sessions with Vidhya Akka were the most enriching and informative. Akka has also been the source for me to learn the art of nattuvangam and mentor me in the same for conducting my very first Arangetram as a teacher. Although my time with Akka has been little, the connection feels longer….maybe a bond beyond this lifetime. Even now, she continues to inspire me through her grace and traditionality for which she is popularly known. Not only me, she has also helped my daughter with some of her choreographic delights which was presented in her Arangetram on the 22nd January 2022. She is a constant source of inspiration for me.</span></p>
