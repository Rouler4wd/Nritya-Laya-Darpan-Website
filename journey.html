The motherly care that Aruna Teacher showered upon me, being tough when she had to be and absolutely loving when I needed it, her patience with me, in time, inculcated the discipline this art form needed and kicked off my learning journey.&nbsp;<br>Aruna Teacher gave me so many opportunities when I was under her wings and I am so grateful to her for initiating this path for me and igniting this passion in me! She now resides in Tanjore District of Tamil Nadu, where she continues to teach young girls. She was recently awarded with Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Award in recognition of her efforts in Bharatanatyam.</p><p></p></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-8 mx-auto" style="margin: 38px;"><img src="/assets/img/33ed1416a41d536d98b30f51737aca30-removebg-preview.png?h=833c7ff9456ce25a847554ab0ab736f3"><p style="text-align: center;"><br><strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">My Enlightener ~ Guru Sri. K.J.Govindarajan Pillai</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Guruji, as I fondly called him, adopted me as his disciple after my first guru moved back south and my yearning for the art form kept brewing. Under his able tutelage and guidance, the love for the art form started growing. Following strict routines, he encouraged me to complete my arangetram. Upon the completion of which, I realized that I could not let go of this aesthetic dance from my life. I was hooked for life! He taught me what it takes to be devoted to this art, how to be a performer on stage and that discipline drives passion!!&nbsp;<br>Just about a year later, Guruji left me and many others only to leave us yearning to be satisfied which in my case was fulfilled by his daughter/disciple Smt. Kalaivani Rajmohan. I trained under her guidance until 2000 after which I moved to Bay Area, CA, USA.</p><p></p></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-8 mx-auto" style="margin: 38px;"><img src="/assets/img/f9f956c3daf74102ff981c6fbe5c40f3-removebg-preview.png?h=243fc8634af5530c326b72fb96b95ad9"><p style="text-align: center;"><br><strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">My Mentor ~ Guru Smt. Gayatri Subramanian</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Gayathri Akka came into my life when I needed a guiding hand, when my quest to learn more remained unfulfilled. Since moving to the USA in 2000, I missed being under the wings of an able Guru who could teach me, correct me, challenge me and keep my quest for learning fulfilled.&nbsp;In 2014, a chance meeting with her through my mother, ended my search and my dream to perform a solo Margam in the US came to fruition. She helped me rediscover myself as a dancer. I spent an entire week with her, from sunrise to sunset discussing only dance and absorbing everything she taught me. I walked out regaining my confidence and reinventing myself as a dancer/performer!&nbsp;</span></p><p></p></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-8 mx-auto" style="margin: 38px;"><img src="/assets/img/8239ab9ff1876e8a6b32a96207a6f7a3-removebg-preview.png?h=a4b2eb576c4e28fee9702225e19b108b"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">My Inspiration ~ Nritya Choodamani Guru Smt. Vidhya Subramanian</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: transparent;">The longing to keep learning, the yearning to be under the able guidance of a Guru is something that I cannot extinguish in me. I sought to pursue my passion to learn more about this divine art from Vidhya Akka. She graciously agreed to carve time out from her busy schedule to train me. Sessions with her were enriching and informative, she showed me the nuances of body language, facial expressions, stage presence and so much more! Akka has been the source for me to learn the art of Nattuvangam and mentored&nbsp; me in the same during my very first Arangetram as a teacher. I spent very little time with her but the learnings will last me a lifetime! Till date, she continues to inspire me through her graceful demeanor and in the way she preserves the traditionality of this divine art! She has also helped my daughter with some of her choreographic delights which was presented in her Arangetram on the 22nd January 2022. Akka is a constant source of inspiration for me.</span></p><p></p></div></div></div></section><!-- Start: Map Clean --><div class="map-clean"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=AIzaSyCwzGUj762y0hCABvkbJ4bC7Pb_hVRnv7o&amp;q=7000+village+parkway+suite+h&amp;zoom=15" width="100%" height="450"></iframe></div><!-- End: Map Clean --><footer></footer><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/script.min.js?h=d1953027678454c794560b0e144881c1"></script></body></html>
